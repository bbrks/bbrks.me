It's been a while since my [last post](https://bbrks.me/sonos-podcasting-via-android/) regarding using PocketCasts to stream podcasts to Sonos... Well I'm here with some good news!

Sonos now has a [beta version of Pocket Casts as a native audio-source](https://blog.shiftyjelly.com/2017/07/20/pocket-casts-sonos-support-beta/)! Go check it out by [joining the Sonos beta](http://www.sonos.com/en/beta/screen) and adding it as usual in the audio-sources menu.

This gives you benefits like resuming podcasts from where you were, regardless of which device you listened on originally, a nicer, more streamlined UI inside Sonos app, and of course not having to index your media :)
