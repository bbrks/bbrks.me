I really should have mentioned this in a blog post sooner, probably as I was planning the trip. But alas. As you may or may not know, I drove my car, and my girlfriend around Europe for nearly two months over summer.

I can honestly say it was the most amazing, daunting, exhausting, exhillerating and fantastic trip I've ever had. It had many ups, many downs and sometimes wishes of coming home early! But I did it, and have a lot of photos to show for it!

Feel free to have a look at the blog we kept over at [wanderings.in](http://wanderings.in) or at the [photo album on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10204912195955357&type=1&l=a4e062493f).
